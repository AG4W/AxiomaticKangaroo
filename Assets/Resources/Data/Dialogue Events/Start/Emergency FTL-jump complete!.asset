    word from CIC and LCOM is dead, so this is all we have for now, I will bring you
    more information as it becomes available.\n\nI have taken the liberty to accumulate
    a priority task list, our current top single priority should be FORMATVITAL_PROCESSEDFUEL.
    \nWe barely have enough for a single jump as of now, and if the <i>Great Evil\u2122</i>
    shows up again we'll be target practice.\n"
